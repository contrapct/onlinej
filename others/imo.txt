Implement binary search to find an element x in a sorted array xs.
Return the first index if x is found, otherwise return the index where
x would be inserted.

Examples:

1)
xs = [1, 3, 10]
x = 10 -> 2

2)
xs = [1, 3, 3, 3, 10]
x = 3 -> 1

3)
xs = [1, 3, 10]
x = 2 -> 1

4)
xs = [1, 3, 10]
x = 20 -> 3

5)
xs = [1, 3, 5, 7]
x = 6 -> 3

int binary_search (vector <int>& xs,int x) {
    int index,left,right,middle;
    
    index=xs.size ();
    for (left=0, right=xs.size()-1; left<=right; ) {
    
        middle = (left+right)>>1;
        
        if (xs[middle]>=x) {
            index=middle;
            right=middle-1;
        }
        else
            left=middle+1;
    }

    return index;
}
